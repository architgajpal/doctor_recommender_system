# Right Doctor For You - Doctor Recommender System
Recommender systems (RS) are used to provide choices to user, based on the past record of the user. RS are also helpful in providing the choices by finding out similarities between the users based on certain parameters. The analysis of the existing RS is helpful to develop a new recommender system that can recommend top doctors to the users. In proposed RS different attributes of healthcare from Indian society are evaluated to implement a new model for recommending the doctors. At the initial stage the proposed model is based on existing healthcare system of Chhattisgarh, India. Through this recommender system the user will be able to get recommendation for their specified disease category in their preferred location. Also the user will be able to view recommendation of doctors irrespective of the disease category.

This recommender system has been implemented using Decision Tree Classification algorithm ID3. The preprocessing of the data and the modelling has all been performed under guidance and real life use case scenarios. Data has been acquired from Chhattisgarh Medical Board official site and resources. The model evaluation has been verified keeping in mind the demographic distribution of the data and past records of the same.
